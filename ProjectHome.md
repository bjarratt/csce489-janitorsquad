Arcade-style action, fast-paced driving, ideally to escape from dinosaurs.

Initial thoughts:

sub-goals  - rescue a friend by completing a level who can then operate turret? gather necessary power-ups or vehicle parts?

story      - time travel?  failed experiments?

mechanics  - mouse control for weapon aiming?  gamepad?  timer?  damage meter?  dino-buddy?
